1) Sliding window method: good for when we are asked to find or calculate something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size
2) Two pointers method: In problems where we deal with _sorted_ arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful.
3) Fast & Slow pointer method: Uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.
